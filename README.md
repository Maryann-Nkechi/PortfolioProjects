# Covid 19 Data Exploration with Tableau Visualization using SQL Queries

## Overview:

The goal of this project is to utilize Tableau to visualize COVID-19 vaccination and death data. 
The initiative endeavors to offer insights into the worldwide impact of COVID-19 by utilizing data from the ['Our World in Data'](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) source.
Kindly note that this website records and updates it's data daily. Hence, the conclusions 
drawn from the analysis of this data are based on Covid-19 data collected between Feburary 24, 2020, and April 30, 2021.

## Data Cleaning:

The Dataset was opened in excel and minimal cleaning was done. Unnecesary colummns for this particular project were removed and the table was split 
into two(CovidDeaths_ and CovidVaccinations) for easier analysis. These two tables will be joined again in sql.
